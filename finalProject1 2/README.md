# Woz_C-_FP
for our final project we created a tax calculator reading in CSV files
This project entirely uses C#, .NET, and LINQ.

# Before you run it

there is 2 lines of code that are specifically set to read certain file paths. You will need to change line 338 to the path on your environment where the item employees.csv is located.
Additionally you will need to do the same thing for line 28 with taxtables.csv.
